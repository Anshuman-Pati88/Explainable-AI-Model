# Explainable AI (XAI) Model 🧠🔍

This project explores **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** by applying interpretability techniques to machine learning models. The goal is to make black-box models more understandable and transparent.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate how XAI techniques such as **LIME**, **SHAP**, or **Feature Importance** can be used to interpret predictions from a trained machine learning model.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- SHAP / LIME
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## 📘 Features

- Data preprocessing and model training
- Integration of XAI tools to interpret the model
- Visual explanations of predictions
- Feature importance plots and explanation charts
